# flatjump

This is a very simple script that will try to mimic the excellent [jumpapp](https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp) for flatpak applications.

The usage is simply:
```bash
flatjump <NAME>
```

The script will search for an open flatpak application with the given name. If it finds it it will focus it, if not it will open a new instance.
